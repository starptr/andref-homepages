<h1>You can stop loading the <code>index.html</code> by default if you really wanted to</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        With a caveat: you can't do this on the server side as the default behavior
        <ul>
            <li>Unless you really really really want me to change this (it's probably an antipattern or something)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It's browser-side only</li>
    <li>You just gotta go to <code>tilde.andref.app/disable-tildepage-index/~username/â€¦</code> instead</li>
</ul>
